# SplitText
Split a text file by delimiter and delete duplicate lines. Written with .Net Core 3.1 Console App.


# Usage
Default delimiter is `;`.

You can use without any arguments, then the app will ask for file location and if you want to split the text or not.

`dotnet run`

If you want to split by a specific delimiter, use the code below:

`dotnet run "filename.txt" "delimiter_here"`

or if you just want to remove duplicates, just enter the filename and say `n` to split question:

`dotnet run "filename.txt"`
